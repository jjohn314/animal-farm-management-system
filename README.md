# Animal Farm Management System

A Java-based desktop application designed to manage livestock records and farm operations
through a role-based graphical user interface. The system supports multiple user roles,
persistent data storage, and modular farm management workflows.

The project simulates an internal management tool used by farm workers, veterinarians,
and administrators to track animals, update records, and manage operational data.

## My Contributions

I focused on the core software engineering and application logic, including:

- Designing and implementing a **Java Swing GUI** for managing livestock records
- Implementing **role-based access control** for different user types
- Integrating **persistent data storage** to maintain farm records across sessions
- Structuring the application using **modular, object-oriented design principles**
- Supporting workflows such as viewing, updating, and managing livestock data

## Key Features

- Role-based user access (Admin, Worker, Veterinarian)
- Desktop GUI built with Java Swing
- Persistent storage of farm and livestock records
- Modular design supporting future extension (databases, networking, automation)

## Notes

This project was developed as part of **CS 440 (Software Engineering I)** at the
University of Illinois Chicago. This repository is a cleaned and curated version
focused on the core application and my individual contributions.
